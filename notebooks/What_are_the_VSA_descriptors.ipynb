    "A couple of weeks ago I read a fun preprint from a collaboration between Microsoft Research and Novartis: [\"Learning chemical intuition from humans in the loop\"](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-knwnv) and noticed that one of the high-ranking descriptors in the authors' analysis of the model they built is `SMR_VSA3` (look at figure 4 in the preprint). Since I've seen that descriptor, or other descriptors from the same family, show up repeatedly when analyzing models, and because I bet that most people don't really have much (if any) idea of what exactly those descriptors are, I figured it's worth a short blog post. \n",
    "\n",
    "The descriptors were introduced in the paper \"A widely applicable set of descriptors\" published by Paul Labute in the Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling back in 2000. [Here's a link](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1093-3263(00)00068-1) Random aside: I'm a bit surprised to see that JMGM still exists... it used to be on my standard reading list back in the day, but I haven't thought about it in years. :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "I won't get deeply into the motivation and derivation, read the paper for that, but Paul wanted to come up with a set of descriptors which were generally useful for QSAR studies. He published a three sets of related descriptors: `SlogP_VSAX`, `SMR_VSAX`, and `PEOE_VSAX` which are all based on the same idea: you calculate the contribution of each atom in the molecule to a molecular property (either LogP, MR, or the partial charge) along with the contribution of each atom to an approximate molecular surface area measure (this is the VSA part), assign the atoms to bins based on the property contributions, and then sum up the VSA contributions for each atom in a bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds complicated, but it isn't. Here's a simple example, the molecule methylamine `CN`\n",
    "\n",
    "| atom | logp contribution | VSA contribution |\n",
    "|---|---------|-------|\n",
    "| C | -0.2035 | 7.048 |\n",
    "| N | -1.019  | 5.734 |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The boundaries of the LogP bins for the `SlogP_VSA` descriptor that the RDKit uses are:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[-0.4, -0.2, 0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6]\n",
    "```\n",
    "So the N would add a contribution of 5.734 to bin 1 and the C would add a contribution of 7.048 to bin 2 (for this descriptor the bins are labelled from 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "The boundaries for SMR and PEOE are:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[1.29, 1.82, 2.24, 2.45, 2.75, 3.05, 3.63, 3.8, 4.0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "and\n",
    "```\n",
    "[-.3, -.25, -.20, -.15, -.10, -.05, 0, .05, .10, .15, .20, .25, .30]\n",
    "```\n",
    "For what it's worth, Here's where you can find those bin definitions in the RDKit source code:\n",
    "- `SlogP_VSA`: https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit-orig/blob/master/Code/GraphMol/Descriptors/MolSurf.cpp#L256\n",
    "- `SMR_VSA`: https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit-orig/blob/master/Code/GraphMol/Descriptors/MolSurf.cpp#L281\n",
    "- `PEOE_VSA`: https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit-orig/blob/master/Code/GraphMol/Descriptors/MolSurf.cpp#L306\n",
    "\n",
    "These descriptors do end up being quite useful, but they at first seem totally non-interpretable. It turns out that this isn't completely true: with a bit of digging it's possible to get a bit of a sense of what the descriptors actually mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "So with that background, let's go figure out what `SMR_VSA3` actually means."
